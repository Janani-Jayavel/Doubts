Feature : BMI

I need to fill the null value for BMI by groupby with 'age','gender','work_type'
which am implementing via class :columntransformer_num

Its working fine seperately

now, i need to perform scaling on top of this BMI column (after implementing groupby)
i.e., i need to combine it with numerical preprocessing pipeline for scaling.
